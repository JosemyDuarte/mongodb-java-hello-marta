# mongodb-java-hello-marta

Just a dummy example for java and mongodb communication.

To make this work you will need a MongoDB in your local machine. Docker make this easy:

```
docker run --name some-mongo -it --rm -p 27017:27017 mongo
```

With mongo running on your machine, feel free to execute the code to see the magic.
